# Recitation/Lab for Inference and Representation 
 
TA: Rahul G. Krishnan (rahul@cs.nyu.edu)

This repository contains the slides (in pdf format) and ipython notebooks used in the recitations for 
Inference and Representation. 

## IPython Notebook

If you haven't used IPython notebook before, its great. It allows you to have a persistant
python interpreter session (akin to MATLAB) that may be embellished with latex, comments, plots generated from data etc.
I'll use it for some small demonstrations and for visualizations. Feel free to clone this repository and play around
with the ipython notebooks.

### What do I need to run the notebooks?

* Install [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). (This is a version of python that comes prepackaged with many scientific 
computing libraries saving you the trouble of dealing with dependencies. It does not affect your system python and can be 
uninstalled by deleting the directory and removing the addition of the directory to your PATH environment variable.)
* Go to the directory where the ipython notebooks are located and run ``ipython notebook``. This will open the ipython notebook in a browser. 
* If there are additional packages required for a specific lab, Ill point them out as we go along. 

### Some useful links

* [Markdown Cheatsheet] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) : Contains commonly used ways to structure text in markdown mode for writing within the notebook
* Use ``%%latex`` at the beginning of the shell to render latex within that shell 
* [IPython Cheatsheet] (https://zenodo.org/record/44973/files/ipynb-cheat-sheet.pdf)
