# Recitation/Lab for Inference and Representation 
 
TA: Rahul G. Krishnan (rahul@cs.nyu.edu)

This repository contains the slides and ipython notebooks used in the recitations for 
Inference and Representation. 

## IPython Notebook

If you haven't used ipython notebook before, its great. It allows you to have a persistant
python interpreter session that may be embellished with latex, comments, plots generated from the data.
I'll use it for some small demonstrations and for visualizations. Feel free to clone this repository and play around
with the ipython notebooks.  

### What do I need to get the notebooks running?

* Install (Anaconda)[https://www.continuum.io/downloads] Python 
* Go to the dire
