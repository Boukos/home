Location: 60 5th ave, 6th floor, room 613.\r\n\r\nJB: Thursdays, 4:00-5:00pm. Location: 60 5th ave, 6th floor, room 612.\r\n\r\n###Grading\r\nproblem sets (45%) + midterm exam (25%) + final project (25%) + participation (5%). \r\n\r\n###Piazza \r\nWe will use [Piazza](http://piazza.com/nyu/fall2016/dsga1005csciga2569/home) to answer questions and post announcements about the course. Please sign up [here](http://piazza.com/nyu/fall2016/dsga1005csciga2569). Students' use of Piazza, particularly for adequately answering other students' questions, will contribute toward their participation grade.\r\n\r\n###Online recordings \r\nMost of the lectures and labs' videos will be posted to NYU Classes. Note, however, that class attendance is required.\r\n\r\n##Schedule\r\n| Week        | Lecture Date           | Topic       |  Reference                    |  Deliverables  |\r\n| ---------------|----------------| ------------|---------------------------------|---------------|\r\n| 2 | 9/12  | **Lec1** Intro and Logistics.

Assigned readings will come from freely-available online material.\r\n#### Core Materials\r\n  - Kevin Murphy, [Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/%7Emurphyk/MLbook/index.html), MIT Press, 2012. You can read this online for free from [NYU Libraries](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/nyulibrary/detail.action?docID=10597102). We recommend the latest (4th) printing, as earlier editions had many typos. You can tell which printing you have as follows: check the inside cover, below the \"Library of Congress\" information. If it says \"10 9 8 ... 4\" you've got the (correct) fourth print.\r\n  - Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman, [Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques](http://pgm.stanford.edu/), MIT Press, 2009.\r\n  - Mike Jordan's notes on [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/prelims/)\r\n  - [MIT lecture notes](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-438-algorithms-for-inference-fall-2014/lecture-notes/) on algorithms for inference.\r\n  - [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/) by Cam Davidson Pilon\r\n  - Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani, and Jerry Friedman, [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/), Second Edition, Springer, 2009.

However, when being stuck on a problem, we encourage you to collaborate with other students in the class, subject to the following rules:\r\n  - You may discuss a problem with any student in this class, and work together on solving it. This can involve brainstorming and verbally discussing the problem, going together through possible solutions, but should not involve one student telling another a complete solution.\r\n  - Once you solve the homework, you must write up your solutions on your own, without looking at other people's write-ups or giving your write-up to others.\r\n  - In your solution for each problem, you must write down the names of any person with whom you discussed it. This will not affect your grade.\r\n  - Do not consult solution manuals or other people's solutions from similar courses.\r\n\r\n#### *Late submission policy*\r\nDuring the semester you are allowed at most two extensions on the homework assignment. Each extension is for at most 48 hours and carries a penalty of 25% off your assignment.\r\n",
