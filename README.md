###Recitation/Laboratory (required for all students)
Wednesdays, 7:10-8:00pm in Warren Weaver Hall 102

###Grading
problem sets (55%) + midterm exam (20%) + final project (20%) + participation (5%). Problem Set policy
Book (required): Kevin Murphy, Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective, MIT Press, 2012. I recommend the latest (4th) printing, as the earlier editions had many typos. You can tell which printing you have as follows: check the inside cover, below the "Library of Congress" information. If it says "10 9 8 ... 4" you've got the (correct) fourth print.

###Piazza 
We will use Piazza to answer questions and post announcements about the course. Please sign up here. Students' use of Piazza, particularly for adequately answering other students' questions, will contribute toward their participation grade.
Online recordings: Most of the lectures and labs' videos will be posted to techtalks.tv. Note, however, that class attendance is required.


##Syllabus
This graduate level course presents fundamental tools of probabilistic graphical models, with the goal of performing inferential tasks on various types of data. We will study latent variable graphical models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Factor Analysis, Gaussian Processes), state-space models for time series (Kalman Filter, HMMs, ARMA), Gibbs Models and deep generative models (Variational autoencoders, GANs), covering both the methods (exact/approximate inference, sampling algorithms, exponential families) and modeling applications to text, images and medical data.
